## Workout Generator
A Python project to create a points based workout generator, integrating with Google sheets for management of available exercises, points per exercise, points targets and tracking workout history.

Uses [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread) for interacting with google sheets.

Potential to use [gspread_pandas](https://github.com/aiguofer/gspread-pandas) for more functionality.
